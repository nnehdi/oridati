# oridati
Oridati is a minimal Python back-end framework for creating fast APIs based on example data, taking a bottom-up approach to data model design. Unlike traditional frameworks, Oridati allows developers to define the data model by creating instances of the data, and the framework infers the model by analyzing these instances.
